# some code with nested loops with python

I have no clue if this will be useful but if it is, great! But it is some random code that I made to practice my skill in python. 

 While loops were nested to figure out the numerical value of three varaibles being a, b, and c.


## There is an input section that figures what number has a positive/negative value.
